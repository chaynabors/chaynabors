### Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m Chay, software engineer at AWS. Me and my team of five were acquired for our work on Fig. (YC S20)

I work across teams and throughout the stack as the primary maintainer for our terminal experiences under Amazon Q. Most of my time is spent writing engineering specs and proposals, but I carve time out for major rewrites and complex features when itâ€™s required.

At Fig we built terminal autocomplete. Our Autocomplete specs are used by enterprises like Amazon and Microsoft, and by startups like Warp as well.
