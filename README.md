### Goodbye GitHub 👋

**I have migrated all of my personal projects to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/chaynabors).**

I’m Chay, software engineer at AWS. Me and my team were acquired for our work on [Fig](fig.io.home). (YC S20)

* I dropped out of school in 2022 and built Fig alongside Grant Gurvis and Sean Sullivan.
* Me and Grant wrote Amazon CodeWhisperer for Command Line.
* I wrote Amazon Q CLI which is now Kiro CLI.
* I now work on [Strands Agents](https://strandsagents.com/latest/) and internal research.

I fool around with graphics, compilers, realtime audio, and game engines in my free time.

Every day I wonder if I should have been an artist instead.
