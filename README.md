### Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m Chay, software engineer at AWS. Me and my team of five were acquired for our work on Fig. (YC S20)

I work across teams and throughout the stack as a contributor to Amazon Q, and as the lead on Q CLI.

At Fig we built terminal autocomplete. Our Autocomplete specs are used by enterprises like Amazon and Microsoft, and by startups like Warp as well.

In my free time I write graphics code. Iâ€™m currently building a desktop environment for ink displays on Nix, but my last hobby project was baking spherical harmonics into lightmaps on the GPU.
